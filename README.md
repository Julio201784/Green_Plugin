# Green_Plugin
An extension that will track the tabs along with the energy consumption and carbon emmisions the tabs have made in total. With this I plan to hopefully reduce carbon emmisions across the globe even if its minimal.

# Steps
1. make a basic hello world plugin for a better understandings of plugins.
2. adjust the plugin to be able to track currently open tabs along with the total time they were open.
3. for each tab that has been open for 24 or more Hours I will popup a recomendation to close the tabs (Possibly add a icon or a "close recomended" tabs button)
4. will find out the energy consumption of the tabs taht are all open (mainly the interactive tabs with adds or videos playing) and display the energy used in the popup
5. Finally I will try and equate the carbon emmisions roughly to be able to show the carbon emmisions that is produced from the left open tabs
